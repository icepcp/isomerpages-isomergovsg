> IMPORTANT: 3rd level navigations will only appear in the left-navigation.

To create a 3rd level navigation, create a new page and add the parameter **second_nav_title** in the main header of the page. 

The **second_nav_title** corresponds to the 2nd level navigation and the **title** will be the title of the page. 

In the example below, "Github Repository" tells isomer that this page belongs to the Github Repository **second-level navigation** while the page **title** is "Overview".

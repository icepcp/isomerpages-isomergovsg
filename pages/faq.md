#### **What is Isomer?**
Isomer is an informational website generator created by the Open Governnment Products team at Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech).

It provides template for website with hosting and is compliant to applicable clauses in the Instruction Manual 8 (IM8), Design Service Standard (DSS) and Usability Checklist (UC). 

We build, provide training and maintain Isomer as a service to all Singapore Government Agencies. This website that you are seeing now is powered by Isomer.

#### **Is Isomer IM8 compliant?**
Isomer is compliant to applicable clauses on IM8. However, if you have specific question about certain IM8 policy, do reach out to the team to have them answered. Or if you have security related question, you can read the Security FAQs.

The fulfillment of these clauses will be centrally managed by Isomer team at GovTech.

#### **What are the responsibilities of my agency for a website that is on Isomer?**
Your agency will be responsible for content migration and maintenance. This includes ensuring that your website content meets content-related standards in DSS. 

Isomer will be responsible for website hosting, maintenance, support and ensuring compliance to relevant clauses of the IM8, DSS and UC.

#### **Does my agency need to pay to have our website to be on Isomer?**
Isomer is free of charge. The service will cover website hosting, maintenance, support and training for the system.

However, do note that domain purchase is not part of Isomer so you still have to procure domains on your own through ITSM (IT Service Management) portal managed by Govtech. 

You should only procure .gov.sg domains unless you have waiver from SNDGO that states otherwise.

#### **Does my agency need to migrate the content from our existing website?**
Your agency will be responsible for choosing what content to migrate and also the migration of the content. 
Isomer will support your agency by providing training on how to use Isomer.

#### **How do Agencies get started on Isomer?**
You can read more about [getting onboard here](/get-started/onboard/) for more information.

#### **What is a sitemap? Why is this important?**
Before you decide to launch a site through Isomer, you should have a sitemap in mind. With that sitemap, we will generate a template that already has those pages listed in your sitemap. 

You can also choose the default template we generate for you, but that means you'll have to rename files, add new folders and do more customisation on your own. The details on customising your sites are also available in this guide. 

A sitemap is a high-level overview of how your site should look like. This includes how many pages and if there are groups of pages that would be parked under a collection (group of pages).

Sitemap helps you plan the content structure of your site and also makes it easier for the isomer team to generate a template that can immediately match your needs. 

See an example of a sitemap below.

#### **What type of websites is Isomer suitable for?**
Here are some quick guides on what's suitable to be hosted on Isomer:
- Your site is purely informational and contains unclassified content that are meant for public consumption.
- Your site does not have transactions (log ins, calculators)
- If you have form, you can consider hosting it on form.gov.sg and embed it onto Isomer site. 

#### **What are my options if I am unable to use Isomer?**
Your agency can consider using the [Singapore Government Design System](https://www.designsystem.gov.sg/). 

The Singapore Government Design System is a collection of UI components and design patterns that were built with the best UX practices in mind. The purpose of the design system is to provide the public with a unified experience across all public-facing government digital services.

Do note that for the Singapore Government Design System (SGDS), your agency will be responsible for developing, hosting, maintaining the website and ensuring that the website is compliant to the IM8 and DSS.

Isomer's design components are also extracted from SGDS. We're working closely with them to ensure that necessary UI components are aligned with what they have.

Design systems are widely used around the world today:
* In Industry: [Google Material design](https://material.io/design/){:target="_blank"}, [Adobe Spectrum](https://theblog.adobe.com/author/the-spectrum-design-team/){:target="_blank"}
* In Government: [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/){:target="_blank"}, [Gov.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/){:target="_blank"}, [Australian Design System](https://designsystem.gov.au/){:target="_blank"}

Alternatively, you can also consider using CWP, which is part of the WOG bulk tender. 

#### **I am not a public officer, can I use Isomer?**

Unfortunately Isomer is only available for government agencies of the Singapore Government. However, if you're interested in using isomer's template or framework for you own development use, you can always refer to [our repositories on Github](https://github.com/isomerpages). Our codebase are opensourced. 

#### **I am a vendor who is participating in a tender from a government agency, can you help?**

We will not be able to provide details beyond what was provided on our official website and in this guide, please reach out the officers whom you're liaising with for further details.
